<p>Despite the Corona crisis, we want to participate again in this year's CanSat competition. With the experience we have gained in recent years, we are starting the <a href="https://www.cansat.de/wettbewerb-2020-21" target="__blank">7th German CanSat Competition 2020/21</a> with confidence and full of anticipation.</p> 

As a mixture of experienced and new members, six of us have come together as a team and registered for this year's competition.

Like every year, the primary mission consists of measurements of temperature and air pressure during the flight, which can be used to calculate the CanSat's altitude and rate of fall. Based on the measured data, a temperature profile along the altitude parameter is created.

For the secondary mission, we have to be able to detect various objects distributed on the earth's surface from altitude and locate them as accurately as possible. They are then displayed on a map to scale.

The team:

Because Jakob and Teresa are already experienced members, they take over the project management of our team. They are also responsible for the CanSat's electronics and hardware. 
The software, on the other hand, is Manuel's and Daniel's specialty. 
Chiara maintains the website and manages the social media channels together with Teresa. 
Anna is responsible for the development and testing of our recovery system, our parachute.
