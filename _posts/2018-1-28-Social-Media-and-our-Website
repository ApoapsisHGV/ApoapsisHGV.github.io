The day is almost over and our social media channels have been updated. Via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Apoapsis_HGV), 
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/apoapsis_hgv/),
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ApoapsisHGV/) and this site you can learn more about our activities
and developments for the CanSat 2018 competition.

The website you are reading is a bit special. Instead of creating it using a website builder,
we wrote it almost completely in Markdown and launched it as a GitHub project.
This means that we can design just about every aspect of the website independently and thatb 
every team member can access everything, which makes collaboration easier.
It also makes it easier for us to setup our database which will be a big part of our secondary mission.

In addition to that, Repositories for the other software components of the project (The ground station and the satellite)
have been created on Github which not only all team mebers can access but every person can gain insight on
our project development.
