New year â€“ new competition! With all the experiences we collected last year, we're looking forward towards the next German CanSat competition with new ideas.

We got new young talented people in our team, so we're eight students in total. Our secondary mission for this year's competition is to take 3D pictures with two cameras and create a relief map from them. To stabilize the CanSat and to prevent rotation, we'll use a reaction wheel.
