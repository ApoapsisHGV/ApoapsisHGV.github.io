Since we submitted the first design report for the CanSat competition on Monday 21.12.2020, we would like to give you a little update on our progress so far. We are at the end of our research phase and will soon order some components for testing. Unfortunately, we won't have much time for testing after the holidays. Due to Covid-19 the schools were closed and our exam period has been pushed back further. This means that the eleventh graders, as well as the ninth graders, will have to study for the exams directly after the holidays. But we also have good news - "knitter-switch", a local company specialising in switch technology, is sponsoring us! 

With these words, we would like to conclude this blog post and wish everyone who is reading it these days a Merry Christmas!
