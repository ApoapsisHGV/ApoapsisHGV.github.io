## About us
We are the team Apoapsis from Vaterstetten. Our group consists of eight students from the Humboldt-Gymnasium Vaterstetten in Baldham near Munich.


## What is a CanSat?
A CanSat is a capsule the size of a standard soda can. Using a small rocket it is launched to a height of about 1000m and then glides back down on a parachute. The sensors on bord provide various data about the environment, such as temperature, pressure, position and more. This data is either transmitted in real time to a ground station or stored in the capsule and collected after the landing.

More information about the challenge can be found on the official CanSat 2019 competition website at [cansat.de](https://cansat.de).


## What does our CanSat do?

It measures air pressure and temperature, takes 3D pictures and stabilizies itself using a reaction wheel.
