## About us
We are the Team Apoapsis from Vaterstetten. Our group consists of 6 students of the 9th to 11th grade of the [Humboldt-Gymnasium Vaterstetten](http://www.humboldt-gym.de/){:target="_blank"} near Munich. This year our team takes part in the German CanSat competition for the 3rd time.


## What is a CanSat?
A CanSat is a mini-satellite the size of a standard beverage can, in which sensors are installed. These sensors measure and record data such as temperature and air pressure during the flight. With the help of a small rocket, the CanSat is shot to an altitude of approx. 1000m and then brought back safely to the ground by a parachute.

More information about the competition can be found on the official CanSat 2020 website at [cansat.de](https://cansat.de){:target="_blank"}.
