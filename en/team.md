  <span>“My name is <strong>Leon Hauser</strong>. In 2018, I already assumed the role of the ‘structural engineer’ (since I'm interested in an engineer's career); I'm responsible for the construction this year as well. I joined the project because I've been interested in the construction of aerospace vehicles for a long time and couldn't resign such an opportunity.”</span>
