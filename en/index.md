After many technical difficulties, we have finally finished building our CanSat and shipped it for launch. 
We are already looking forward to watching the livestream of the rocket launch and to evaluating the data recorded by our CanSat.

But how does our CanSat work?

Our CanSat has several sensors, a Raspberry Pi Zero W, a Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 and an Arduino Nano. 

Via a temperature, air pressure and humidity sensor connected to the Arduino, measurement data is recorded. With the help of the Raspberry Pi, this data is stored on  2 USB sticks. The same applies to a NTC-Thermistor.Â 
The camera is directly connected to the Raspberry Pi and starts taking pictures as soon as it receives a signal sent by the Arduino. The images are stored on the USB sticks, just like the measurement data was saved.

We also have a special feature on board - a motor operated reaction wheel!

It stabilizes the CanSat during flight and prevents the rolling shutter effect.

With the help of the data of an accelerometer it is possible to find out in which "state of movement", the CanSat is currently located. This means the CanSat can determine whether the rocket launched with the CanSat or whether it is already falling.

When the CanSat lands, the buzzer is triggered and emits a loud beep, making it easier to find the CanSat.

The launch is scheduled for Tuesday, May 25 at 1 p.m., and will be streamed live at <a href="https://dlrschoollab.keymachine.eu/b/dr--e9v-hhc-g41" >https://dlrschoollab.keymachine.eu/b/dr--e9v-hhc-g41</a>.

Depending on the weather,  the launch day may be postponed to May 27 or May 31.
