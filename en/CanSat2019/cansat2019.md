    <p>Our mission is called <abbr title="Apoapsis is an astronomical term: It describes the furthest point of an orbit from the central mass.">Apoapsis</abbr>, with which we want to take part at the ESA's German CanSat competition of 2019.</p>
    <p><strong>What is a CanSat?</strong> A mini satellite at the size of a soda can.</p><!--beverage can?-->
    <p><strong>What does our CanSat?</strong> It measures air pressure, temperature and takes 3D photographs, while stabilizing itself with a reaction wheel.</p>

## The competition in Bremen

</figure>

From 23 to 27 September, we were in Bremen and launched our CanSat in a rocket! We also presented our project at a poster presentation and – after the data evaluation – in a final presentation ([PDF download](/images/2019-Startkampagne/Endpraesentation.pdf)) in front of the jury. Unfortunately not everything worked as we planned: The software for our STM chip was not ready in time, and therefore we could not use the cameras, the reaction wheel, the gyroscope and other sensors during the flight. However, our [backup system](/Backup-Lösungen/) worked, so we could at least measure air pressure and temperature.

Nevertheless, we were able to convince the jury with our ideas, especially for the ground station - and won 3rd place! Second was team [GiS Worlds](http://www.gis-wf.de/cansat-wettbewerb/) and the winners are [CANone](http://www.gis-wf.de/cansat-wettbewerb/) from Wolfsburg. Congratulations! However, none of the eight teams was a loser in the end, because we learned so much during the whole project.
